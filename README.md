# 3D Shape Visualizations

This repository contains interactive 3D visualizations of various geometric shapes using Three.js, organized by educational purpose.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **chemistry/visualizations/** - Visualizations related to chemistry education
- **mathematics/visualizations/** - Visualizations related to mathematics education
- **shared/visualizations/** - Visualizations that can be used for both chemistry and mathematics education
- **assets/** - Shared assets (if any)

## Available Visualizations

### Chemistry Visualizations

1. **Diamond Crystal Structure** - [chemistry/visualizations/diamond_visualization.html](chemistry/visualizations/diamond_visualization.html)
   - Visualization of a diamond cubic crystal structure with tetrahedral bonding
   - Interactive rotation and zoom capabilities
   - Useful for teaching molecular structures in chemistry

### Mathematics Visualizations

1. **Rectangular Prism** - [mathematics/visualizations/rectangular_prism_visualization.html](mathematics/visualizations/rectangular_prism_visualization.html)
   - Visualization of a 3D rectangular prism (cuboid) with adjustable dimensions
   - Interactive rotation and zoom capabilities
   - Useful for teaching geometry and spatial reasoning in mathematics

### Shared Visualizations

1. **Tetrahedron** - [shared/visualizations/tetrahedron_visualization.html](shared/visualizations/tetrahedron_visualization.html)
   - Visualization of connected tetrahedrons with shared corners, each with center points
   - Interactive rotation and zoom capabilities
   - Useful for both chemistry (molecular structures) and mathematics (geometry) education

## How to Use

1. Open any of the HTML files in a web browser
2. The visualizations are interactive:
   - Click and drag to rotate the shape
   - Scroll to zoom in and out

## Technical Details

- All visualizations are built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- Each visualization consists of an HTML file and a corresponding JavaScript file
- The visualizations are designed to be educational tools for understanding 3D geometric structures
